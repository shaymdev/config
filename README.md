# personal configuration files

### Vim
For vim on windows (gvim) in your user directory `~/` create symlink (might need to use gitbash or other bash shell) with `ln -s c:/path/to/this/config/vim vimfiles` and one for vimrc with `ln -s c:/path/to/this/config/vim \_vimrc`
Also, create a `~/.backup/.swap` and `~/.backup/.undo` as defined by the vimrc for storing swap files and persistent undo. You'll need to do it from the commandline because windoze.
